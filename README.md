# Press2Hold
When you press a specific keybind, all currently pressed keys stay held until you release them manually by pressing the keybind again.
Because of the Java 21 requirement, only supports versions 1.20.5 and up.

Known issues:
When the keybind is changed from the default the mod will also hold down that key. Doesn't affect functionality, just looks ugly.
Some keys (most notably the entire function row) won't show the key, but their GLFW key token.
